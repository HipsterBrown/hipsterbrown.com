# This is the open source version of my personal website

With my old personal site, which was built with a minimal amount of PHP, I was not comfortable with making incremental updates to the design or architecture. So I decided to not redesign but rebuild the underlying architecture of the php templates with Jekyll instead.

It is now much easier for me to work locally, create an extensive portfolio section, and upload new content by using Jekyll. I was originally planning on replacing my Anchor blog with Ghost but changed my mind to keep the blogging area as Jekyll to keep the amount of redirects to a minimum. Keeping a copy of the site on GitHub is nice for managing issues & features and getting feedback from the community.

The site is now live at [hipsterbrown.com](http://hipsterbrown.com) and will be worked on openly from here. You can see a "beta" version of the site at [new.hipsterbrown.com](http://new.hipsterbrown.com) as I test out new features. I will probably start writing about some of the thought processes behind designing these new features and implementing them, so follow along on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hipsterbrown) to see when I post new Hip Musings.

Cheers and thanks for checking out the repo.

# This is the open source version of my personal website

With my current live site, which is built with a minimal amount of PHP, I'm not comfortable with making incremental updates to the design or architechture. So I decided to not redesign but rebuild the underlying architecture of the php templates with Jekyll instead.

It will be much easier for me to work locally, create an extensive portfolio section, and upload new content by using Jekyll. I also plan on replacing my current blogging platform, Anchor CMS, with Ghost for increased usability and speed.

This is a WIP and I may post a staging link once I get that far in development testing.

This is the open source version of my personal website. It has gone through several architectures over the years:

- PHP (some custom pages along with [Anchor CMS](https://anchorcms.com/))
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) [Current]

The core focus of each rebuild is to make it easier for me to work locally, iterate on the overall design, and ship new content without hassle.

Cheers and thanks for checking out the repo.

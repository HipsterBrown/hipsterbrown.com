# This is the open source version of my personal website

With my current live site, which is built with a minimal amount of PHP, I'm not comfortable with making incremental updates to the design or architechture. So I decided to not redesign but rebuild the underlying architecture of the php templates with Jekyll instead.

It will be much easier for me to work locally, create an extensive portfolio section, and upload new content by using Jekyll. I was originally planning on replacing my Anchor blog with Ghost but changed my mind to keep the blogging area as Jekyll to keep the amount of redirects to a minimum. 

This is a WIP and I may post a staging link once I get that far in development testing.

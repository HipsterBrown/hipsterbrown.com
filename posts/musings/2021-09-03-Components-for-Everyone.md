JS frameworks have taken off due to the component abstraction enabled workflow out of the box. Tools like NextJS, Nuxt, Gatsby, and SvelteKit are built upon JS frameworks and have become popular due to this abstraction. There are some exceptions coming from places like Bridgetown, which have created a Liquid component and support ViewComponent (as popularized by GitHub/Rails). 

SSR doesn‚Äôt count because it still requires JS as the platform to render to HTML and context switching from other languages. 

Other examples of server-driven component workflows:

- Blade components (https://dev.to/ericchapman/laravel-blade-components-5c9c)
- liquid components (https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs/components/liquid)
- Django Unicorn components (https://www.django-unicorn.com/)
- Blazor .Net components (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/blazor-for-web-forms-developers/components)
- Marko components integrate with express/fastify/koa ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Workflow tooling:

- storybook (or some type of isolated development playground)
- Unit testing
- Packaging (can they ship as a reusable resource/gem/pub)
- Sidecar assets (?)

What about web components?

- requires JS
- Hard to SSR
- Nice for ‚Äúhybrid components‚Äù when combined with server-driven templating component frameworks (https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs/components#hybrid-components)

_TL;DR I will start using a loose [design doc](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/278258) format to share various ideas, ranging from super specific and plausible solutions to quite ambiguous and theoretical._

## Background

["Design Docs at Google"](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/)
["IEEE Guide to Software Design Descriptions"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/278258)
[Google's docuemntation about writing technical documents](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/documents)

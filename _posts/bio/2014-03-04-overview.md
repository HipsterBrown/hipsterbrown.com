As a **creative**, **driven**, and **passionate** individual, I strive to explore new ideas and improve upon old ones. My focus on great **user experience** and **functional design standards** not only applies to web/mobile products but my background in business and psychology as well. I find great **leadership** to be defined as the ability to bring people together to accomplish a goal rather than simply directing others from above. My ultimate goal is to not only **design** useful products for the world to use but see them through **production** and beyond as well.

## University of Central Florida - Orlando, FL

### Major: Industrial/Organizational Psychology

My interest in psychology has always stemmed from my **focus on people** and what drives them. While the I/O Psych track concentrates on **psychological applications in business**, the same lessons can be easily translated to the **web and mobile technology industries.**

### Minor: Leadership Studies

Pursuing a study of leadership started as course requirements for the LEAD Scholars program, and grew into a further interest as it connected with my fondness of psychology and business. The degree path takes a look at the various **leadership philosophies** and pairs them with **real-world application.**

### Grad Date: Spring 2014

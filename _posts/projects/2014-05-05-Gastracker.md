With GasTracker, I decided to take a real crack at single-page webapp design. I came up with the idea for GasTracker from my daily use of RunKeeper during my bike rides to and from school, work, etc. I wanted to calculate how much gas I was saving by biking instead of driving and use the RunKeeper data to do that. I created an HTML/CSS prototype for the design with plans to implement the working JavaScript sometime in the future.

As an early backer of the Pebble smartwatch during their Kickstarter campaign in mid-2012, I have been most excited about this new path for technology and the ability to design my own watchfaces; I have seen a few PSD mockups for this task but as a Sketch user, I decided to create my own. It was well received in the Pebble community with over 2000 downloads of the black and white designs. I plan to use my design skills to bring great looking watchfaces to Pebble users worldwide.

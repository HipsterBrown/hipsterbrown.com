    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome from Nick Hehr, aka HipsterBrown.</p>
    <p>I am an empathetic community member and full-stack JavaScript developer currently residing in New York City,
      where I enjoy biking and bouldering whenever possible. In my free time, I help maintain various open source
      projects including <a href="https://hipsterbrown.github.io/xs-dev">xs-dev</a> & <a
        href="https://robo-wizard.js.org/">Robo Wizard</a> and contribute to <a
        href="https://www.ecma-international.org/technical-committees/tc53/">TC53</a>. My mustache is just a figment of
      your imagination.
    </p>
    <p>Please explore my site freely and with an open mind, from resources for studying <a
        href="http://more-empathy.online/">Empathy</a> to some examples of my open source work via <a
        href="https://github.com/HipsterBrown">GitHub</a>. The occasional thought or topic that can't fit in 140
      characters can be found in my <a href="/musings">Musings</a> blog.</p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>

    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome from Nick Hehr, aka HipsterBrown.</p>
    <p>I am an empathetic member community member and front-end developer currently residing in New York City. In my free time, I help maintain <a href="http://hood.ie">Hoodie</a>, contribute to the <a href="https://tessel.io">Tessel Project</a>, and co-organize <a href="http://manhattanjs.com">ManhattanJS</a>.</p>
    <p>Please explore my site freely and with an open mind, from resources for studying <a href="http://more-empathy.online/">Empathy</a> to some examples of my open source work via <a href="https://github.com/HipsterBrown">GitHub</a>. The occasional thought or topic that can't fit in 140 characters can be found in my <a href="/musings">Musings</a> blog.</p>
	<p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
